### Introduction

My idea is to create a Chinese lantern, as it was recently Chinese New Year. Typically, people use lanterns during the New Year, but once the celebration ends, they have to wait an entire year before using them again. I want to incorporate this symbolism into my installation, allowing people to experience the slow passage of time and the hardships of life while interacting with it.
